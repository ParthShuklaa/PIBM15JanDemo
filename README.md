# 📌 Python Certification Preparation & Open Source Project Development

## Python Certification Preparation & Open Source Project Development

This repository is a **learning and demonstration workspace** created as part of a **PIBM (Pune Institute of Business Management) technical demo session – 15 Jan**.

The repository is designed with a **dual purpose**:

1. **Preparation for Python certification exams** (fundamentals to intermediate level)
2. **Hands-on exposure to open-source project development using Python**, including:

   * Python-based backend logic
   * Python frontend frameworks
   * Open-source databases

The focus is on building **certification readiness + real-world development confidence** through structured, instructor-led demonstrations.
