## PIBM15JanDemo

Enterprise-focused **Angular training and demonstration project** created as part of
a **PIBM (Pune Institute of Business Management) Frontend Development session**.

This repository represents a **hands-on Angular application** used to introduce
learners to **modern frontend frameworks, component-based architecture, and
Angular CLI workflows** in a structured, instructor-led environment.

---

### 🎯 Training Objective
To help learners:
- Understand **Angular fundamentals and project structure**
- Work with **Angular CLI for scaffolding and builds**
- Learn **component-based architecture**
- Explore **configuration, testing, and build pipelines**
- Gain exposure to **real-world frontend project setup**

---

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Angular 13.1.2
- TypeScript
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Node.js & npm
- Angular CLI
- Karma (Unit Testing)

---

### 🧱 Architecture Overview
This project follows **standard Angular enterprise architecture**:

- `angular.json` → Workspace & build configuration
- `src/app` → Component-based UI structure
- `package.json` → Dependency & script management
- `tsconfig*.json` → TypeScript compilation setup
- `karma.conf.js` → Unit testing configuration

The structure is intentionally kept **close to real enterprise projects**
to familiarize learners with **production-grade Angular applications**.
